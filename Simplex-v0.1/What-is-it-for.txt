SIMPLEX is an shader built form Blender 2.79 Cycles nodes to mimic Global Illumination and acts in part as a biased renderer.
This is early version of it that needs improvement - but it works, and works fine!

This shader uses Cycles AO shader for Diffuse Ray.
It helps to make brighter scene with less noise - very similar to the biased renderers.

- Render time has been reduced by 25%.
- Rendering need less samples to look noiseless
- quasi-GI gives nice lighting to the interior scene


Shader BIASED options:
--- "BIASED RENDERING" - turning the qGI on
It should be in the position 0 or 1. Otherwise render time can be longer than normal no-qGI Cycles.
Value 0 = no qGI - works like typical Cycles
Value 1 = qGI is on and AO Shader makes some nice mess in Diffuse channel :)
This option works for current material only, but can be override by interal shader value "GLOBAL GI BIASED RENDERING ENABLER"

--- "BIASED GI Mat. Brigthness" - sets how bright GI will be 
( it is related with internal shader value "GLOBAL GI Brigthness DELTA" that is set to -0.35 by default)

--- "BIASED Diffuse Separation" - show only Diffuse Ray rendering
This option is usefull for setting material Diffuse channel on first state of noisy rendering.
It separates Diffuse ray from any other ray that that could add noise to the surface.

--- "BIASED Resaturator" - makes colors saturataion a bit nicer when qGI is enabled


Shader Internal Values:
*** "GLOBAL GI BIASED RENDERING ENABLER" - overrides BIASED RENDERING option for all materials that use SIMPLEX shader

*** "GLOBAL GI Brigthness DELTA" - sets default value of qGI brightness

*** "GLOBAL Diffuse Separation OVERRIDE" - sets BIASED Diffuse Separation option active for all materials that use SIMPLEX shader
So you can see the colors and textures with AO shading without reflections.
TIP: If you override this value to 0.50 you can have very fast preview with partial reflective shading.
It gives you very low noise on all surfaces that uses SIMPLEX material. 
But remember that all shiny surfaces and metals has more diffuse color ( glossy is lowered, cause only 0.25 reflection rays are propagated ). But it is fast as hell - good for modelling and some light works.
